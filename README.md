Coursework - Dimension reduction and face classification
=================================================

Coursework where we had to program some dimension reduction techniques and apply them to face classification.

Goals and context
--------------------
The goal of this coursework is to gain a deeper understanding at different methods of dimensionality reduction.
Besides seeing how these techniques can be used to understand how the data is shaped, we will further use these
techniques as a way to decrease the complexity of our dataset and yet perform classification with satisfying
results. The last part is dedicated to the application of a technique of independent component analysis: FastICA.
To do that, we will use a dataset provided by the University of Yale ([Yale Faces B](http://cvc.yale.edu/projects/yalefacesB/yalefacesB.html)). It contains roughly 2400 black and white pictures of some 37 people.
